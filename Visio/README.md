Computer Vision (by Cyril)
--------------------------

1. Demo (python) :  
Launch nao_grab_cam.py in SSH session ; NAO will track and follow red objects (JOGs, other NAOs, tomatoes, ...)

2. Image processing (C++ and qibuild) : 
Compilation and cross-compilation in order to use OpenCV with NAO. See `HOWTO.md`.
